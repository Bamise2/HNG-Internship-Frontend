                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate developer embarking on my journey into backend development through the HNG Internship. 
                    Coming from a frontend background, I've always been fascinated by how systems work behind the scenes. 
                    This internship represents a significant step in expanding my technical skillset and becoming a full-stack developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in technology stems from a desire to build solutions that make a real difference. 
                    Whether it's creating intuitive user interfaces or architecting robust backend systems, I'm driven by 
                    the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

                <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
                <p>I'm approaching this internship with clear objectives that will shape my learning journey:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Master FastAPI and Python backend development to build scalable REST APIs</li>
                    <li>Gain hands-on experience with database design, ORMs, and SQL/PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Learn deployment practices and DevOps fundamentals through real-world projects</li>
                    <li>Understand authentication, authorization, and API security best practices</li>
                    <li>Develop strong debugging and problem-solving skills in production environments</li>
                    <li>Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate practical backend development skills</li>
                    <li>Connect with fellow developers and learn from the HNG community</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Low Confidence Areas -->
            <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
                <h2>Areas Where I'm Building Confidence</h2>
                <p>Growth comes from acknowledging what we don't yet know. Here are areas I'm actively working to improve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Database optimization and query performance tuning</li>
                    <li>Implementing complex authentication systems (OAuth, JWT best practices)</li>
                    <li>Microservices architecture and when to use it appropriately</li>
                    <li>Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests</li>
                    <li>Cloud infrastructure management and DevOps workflows</li>
                    <li>Handling race conditions and concurrent operations in distributed systems</li>
                    <li>API versioning strategies for production applications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I view these challenges not as obstacles but as opportunities for growth. Each project in this 
                    internship is a chance to strengthen these areas through practice and learning.

            <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
                <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>
                        Remember this moment. Right now, you're at the beginning of something transformative. 
                        The confusion you feel when debugging that environment variable issue? The frustration of seeing 
                        default values in production? These struggles are shaping you into a better developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you look back at this code in six months or a year, you'll smile at how far you've come. 
                        But never forget the persistence it took to get there. Every error message taught you something. 
                        Every deployment failure made you more resilient. Every concept that seemed impossible eventually 
                        became second nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep that curiosity alive. Keep asking "why" instead of just accepting "how." The developers 
                        you admire today were once exactly where you are now. The difference? They didn't give up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You've got this. Keep building, keep learning, and most importantlyâ€”keep believing in yourself.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <!-- Extra Thoughts -->
            <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
                <h2>Additional Reflections</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>On Learning:</strong> I've discovered that the best way to learn backend development is by 
                    building real projects. Reading documentation is essential, but nothing compares to the lessons learned 
                    from deploying an actual API and watching it handle real requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>On Community:</strong> The HNG Internship has shown me the value of learning alongside others. 
                    When I'm stuck, I know there are peers facing similar challenges. This shared experience makes the 
                    journey less isolating and more collaborative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>On the Future:</strong> I'm excited about where this internship will take me. Whether it's 
                    landing my first backend role, contributing to open-source projects, or building my own products, 
                    I know the skills I'm developing here will be foundational to whatever comes next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>On Gratitude:</strong> Thank you to the HNG team for creating this opportunity, and to everyone 
                    who has supported my journey so far. Here's to the growth that lies ahead!
